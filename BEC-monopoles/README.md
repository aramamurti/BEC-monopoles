# Path-Integral Monte Carlo (Standard Algorithm) for Bosons

This is a PIMC code intended for study of the Bose-Einstein condensation of magnetic monopoles. Included is also an implementation of the code for He-4 and the simple harmonic oscillator, as well as a single-component Bose-Coulomb system, as test cases.
